    """Tool for strategic reflection on research progress and decision-making.
    
    üî• CRITICAL: This tool MUST be used at key decision points in research workflow:
    1. BEFORE starting research: Plan strategy and approach
    2. AFTER each tool execution: Evaluate results and plan next steps
    3. BEFORE concluding: Assess if information is sufficient for complete answer

    When to use (MANDATORY):
    - Before any research: What is my strategic approach and priority areas?
    - After receiving search results: What key information did I find? What gaps remain?
    - Before deciding next steps: Do I have enough to answer comprehensively?
    - When assessing research gaps: What specific information am I still missing?
    - Before concluding research: Can I provide a complete answer now?

    Reflection should address:
    1. Strategic planning - What is my approach and priority for this research step?
    2. Analysis of current findings - What concrete information have I gathered?
    3. Gap assessment - What crucial information is still missing?
    4. Quality evaluation - Do I have sufficient evidence/examples for a good answer?
    5. Strategic decision - Should I continue searching or provide my answer?

    Args:
        reflection: Your detailed reflection on research strategy, progress, findings, gaps, and next steps

    Returns:
        Confirmation that reflection was recorded for decision-making
